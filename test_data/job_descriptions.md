## AI-Powered Python Developer for JIRA Automation Prototype

### Summary
I am developing a simple proof of concept (POC) that involves integrating JIRA with OpenAI. The goal is
to fetch data from a JIRA project and analyze it using the OpenAI API (e.g., GPT-4 or GPT-3.5). There
are no fixed requirements on the type or amount of analysis — even a minimal working example is
acceptable. The primary objective is to demonstrate successful communication between JIRA and
OpenAI in a single working flow. The developer should be experienced with both APIs and able to write
clean, well-documented code. Python is preferred, but I'm open to other languages if justified.
Deliverables include a working script or app, clear documentation, and basic explanation of the output. If
successful, this POC may lead to additional AI-integrated automation work.

## Senior Python and Claude Code Engineer to Build CSV-to-Marketplace Integration

### Summary
Job Overview
The Challenge
Here's the problem we need to solve:
The Problem:
• 100+ cannabis dispensaries want to sell on our platform
• Each dispensary uses a different POS system (Dutchie, Flowhub, Treez, etc.)
• Building direct API integrations with each POS would take years
• These POS companies see us as competition and won't give us API access
Our Solution:
• Every POS system can export inventory data as CSV files
• Dispensaries will export their inventory CSV every 30 minutes
• We'll use Google Drive to automatically sync these files to the cloud
• Your job: Build a system that turns these CSV files into live inventory on our marketplace
Why This Matters:
• Dispensaries can join our platform in 10 minutes (not weeks)
• No expensive API integrations needed
• Works with ANY POS system that exports CSV
• Dispensaries stay in control of their data
The Role
You'll build a complete inventory sync system that connects cannabis dispensaries to our marketplace. Think of it as building a smart bridge between old-school POS systems and our modern platform.
What You'll Actually Build:
Week 1 - The Core System:
1. A Python Service that:
o Watches Google Drive folders for new CSV files
o Reads messy inventory data from different POS systems
o Cleans up the data (fixes prices, categories, product names)
o Sends clean data to our PHP platform
2. A Simple Setup Wizard that:
o Guides dispensary owners through connection setup
o Shows them exactly which buttons to click in their POS
o Tests their connection in real-time
o Takes less than 10 minutes to complete
3. Google Sheets Integration that:
o Gives each dispensary their own inventory spreadsheet
o Updates automatically when new CSVs arrive
o Shows errors if something goes wrong
o Acts as a backup of their data
IMPORTANT:
YOU ARE FAMILIER WITH AND WILL USE CLAUD CODE TO ACCELARATE DEVELOPMENT
• Keep response times under 5 seconds
• Handle edge cases (huge files, weird formats, network issues)
Real Example of What You'll Solve:
Dispensary A uses Flowhub and exports:
SKU,Product,Price,Inventory
FL-001,"Blue Dream, 3.5g",$45.00,25
Dispensary B uses Dutchie and exports:
product_id|name|retail_price|stock_qty
DUT-420|Blue Dream 1/8th|45|25
Your system needs to understand both formats and turn them into:
json

  "sku": "FL-001",
  "name": "Blue Dream 3.5g",
  "price": 45.00,
  "quantity": 25,
  "category": "Flower"

Success Looks Like:
• Day 1-3: Core sync system working with test data
• Day 4-5: Setup wizard live and tested with real dispensary
• Day 6-7: System deployed and handling 10+ dispensaries
Your First Week:
• Day 1-2: Build Google Sheets integration pipeline in Python

## Automation Expert for Notion + GPT Content Workflow (Test Project for Long-Term Work)

### Summary
Hi there

I’m looking for an automation specialist to help me set up a weekly content workflow using Notion, ChatGPT (via Make.com or n8n), and tools like Buffer, Twitter API, and (optionally) browser automation for Squarespace.

This first job is a test  - but I’m actively looking for someone I can work with long-term on complex automation projects across my agency. If we work well together, there’s plenty more ahead.

I already have a full content planning system set up in Notion. I now want to automate the content production and distribution process. Here’s the ideal flow:
1. Trigger: I change a blog item’s status in Notion to “Underway”
2. Automatically:
• Send the blog plan to GPT (via Make.com or n8n) to generate a full blog draft
• Save the draft in Notion for review
3. Once Approved:
• Generate 21 tweets from the blog content in a specific tone of voice (either using Claude, or a second GPT prompt)
• Save tweets to a Notion database
• Schedule tweets (3/day for 7 days) via Buffer, Publer, or similar
4. Also:
• Generate 4 Instagram captions + short video ideas (based on the same blog)
• Save these to Notion
• I will upload the visuals manually
• Once marked “Ready to post,” the automation should schedule the IG posts
5. Bonus (optional):
If you’re able to automate Squarespace blog publishing via Puppeteer/Browserless or other method, that’s a huge plus — but not essential.

⸻

Tools You’ll Need Experience In:
• Make.com (or n8n if preferred)
• OpenAI / ChatGPT API
• Notion API
• Buffer / Later / Typefully / Publer
• Webhooks, automations, JSON parsing
• (Optional) Puppeteer or Browserless for browser-based automations

⸻

What I’m Looking For
• Someone who can build clean, reusable workflows
• Great communication and documentation
• Comfortable with testing + debugging
• Someone who thinks proactively — I don’t want to micromanage every step

This will be a paid test project, and if it goes well, I have much more work coming — including AI-driven lead gen, advanced n8n builds, Zapier and Notion workflows, and a few software products in stealth.

⸻

Please apply with:
• A short intro
• 1–2 examples of automation systems you’ve built (bonus points if Notion + Make + GPT)
• Your preferred stack (e.g. Make, Zapier, n8n)
• Your availability over the next 2 weeks

⸻

## Hiring Expert n8n Developer to Build GPT-Enabled Agents (ClickUp, HubSpot, Airtable, Slack)

### Summary
We run a HubSpot-focused RevOps consultancy working with B2B SaaS companies and are looking for an experienced n8n expert to help us build and maintain a growing network of AI-driven operational agents.

These agents are not basic workflows. They’re autonomous assistants powered by GPT (OpenAI or Claude), working across ClickUp, Slack, Airtable, and HubSpot with memory, conditional logic, and structured outputs.

DO NOT MESSAGE DIRECTLY. The prompts are paramount to your application being reviewed, so please fill them out if you want to be considered.

Example Agents We’ve Built (You’ll Extend/Maintain):
-Weekly Reports Agent-  Pulls ClickUp tasks, parses custom fields (QA deliverables, approval comments), syncs data into Airtable, and drafts client-ready summaries via GPT.
-Intake Bot Agent- Listens to Slack messages, parses client/project names, maps them to Airtable records using fuzzy logic, and auto-creates ClickUp tasks with fallback logic.
-Task Structuring Agent- Converts vague Slack requests into a parent task + subtasks using GPT (Claude/OpenAI), including assignee logic and task descriptions.

You’ll be expected to understand and extend this level of logic and implementation.

Tech Stack Involved:
-n8n (agent-style modular builds, execution control, error handling)
-OpenAI / Claude (prompt engineering, memory context, structured output)
-ClickUp API (task creation, field parsing, subtasks, statuses)
-Slack API (event triggers, task intake)
-Airtable (fallback memory + routing)
-HubSpot (occasionally for deal and contact enrichment)
-Webhooks & OAuth2 (for clean integration & retry logic)

Expectations:
-Strong async communication over Slack + email
-Weekly updates via short reports or Loom
-Availability to iterate on multiple agents over time
-Clear, maintainable flows with smart error handling

Requirements:
-2+ years building advanced n8n workflows
-Hands-on experience with OpenAI, Claude, or similar LLMs inside automation
-Familiarity with ClickUp, Airtable, and Slack APIs
-Can implement memory, fallback logic, and dynamic prompt routing
-Writes clean, modular nodes with documentation

### Questions

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

## Build a Smart AI Dashboard for a Project Management Consultancy

### Summary
Hi! I am looking for a skilled developer to help my AI-powered “Pre-Contracts Dashboard” to life for a project management consultancy working in the construction/property industry in Australia.

I already have a working front-end (built in Bolt.new) — now I need someone to connect it to their internal file system (Teams/SharePoint) and build in the AI functionality that will save them hours on CVs, tenders, and proposals.

🧠 What This Tool Will Do for Them
This dashboard will behave like a helpful in-house assistant that helps project managers prepare polished documents in a few clicks.

Phase 1 (for this Contract): CV Automation
Upload a tender → tool scans it for client, role, sector, scope

Automatically matches the best-suited team member(s) based on CVs

Picks 2–3 of the most relevant project experiences

Generates a CV in their preferred format (branded Word/PDF template)

Auto-writes a tailored bio, summary, and project highlights

Allows user to edit or regenerate sections with AI (e.g. “Make shorter” / “Add health sector focus”)

One-click export to PDF or Word

📝 Important:
CVs must be output in their own Word template — not just plain documents. This means maintaining branding, layout, headings, fonts, and spacing exactly as per their existing format (we'll provide samples).

Phase 2: (Scope for Ongoing Work if Phase 1 goes well)
Generate Capability Statements (formatted PDF decks based on sector + projects)

Build a Business Development Tracker (pipeline of leads/opportunities)

Assist with tender writing (auto-generate sections, paste templates, etc.)

Long-term goal: act as a smart pre-con assistant tailored to their company voice

🧩 How It Works Technically
We’re keeping this simple, secure, and user-controlled.

Users upload tenders, or drop CVs + project data into a Teams/SharePoint folder

The system reads only what they upload

No deep integration — just folder-based access via Microsoft Graph API

Tool continuously checks the folder and updates as files change or get added

This gives them control, and you a clear data source to work with.

💻 Tech Stack
Front end: Already built (Bolt.new)

Backend: You choose (Node / Python / Express etc.)

Data source: SharePoint / Teams folders via Microsoft Graph API

AI: OpenAI API (likely GPT-4) — we’ll provide prompt structure + logic

Output: Word (templated), PDF export

Hosting: Flexible (Vercel, Azure, etc.)

✅ Ideal Developer
You're a good fit if:

You’ve worked with Microsoft Graph API (SharePoint, Teams folders)

You’ve built AI-powered document tools (CVs, bios, reports, etc.)

You’re confident generating branded Word documents from dynamic content

You think like a product person: “How can I make this easy and intuitive?”

Bonus if you’ve worked in or around construction, consulting, or service businesses.

### Questions

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

Are you comfortable working with a partially built front end (e.g. Bolt.new), and plugging in back-end logic and AI services?
Have you built a document automation tool that generates editable Word or PDF files using templates?
Have you ever done work for a consultancy, professional services firm, or any company in construction, engineering, or project management?
Is your proposal Ai written or did you read all the requirements?

## Senior n8n Expert Needed for Workflow Debugging and Improvement

### Summary
We are seeking a senior-level n8n expert to assist in debugging, fixing, and enhancing a critical production workflow. The ideal candidate will have extensive experience with n8n automation, optimizing processes, and resolving complex issues efficiently. Your expertise will be vital in ensuring the reliability and performance of our workflows.
The workflow is already built but has several reliability and performance issues that need an experienced eye.

Specifically, your task will be to:
✅ Diagnose and fix OAuth2 token refresh – currently, the workflow fails after tokens expire, indicating the refresh mechanism is not configured properly.
✅ Optimize a long-running workflow that currently takes ~20 minutes and sometimes fails due to performance bottlenecks or inefficient design.
✅ Fix webhook timeout issues – incoming webhooks fail intermittently due to slow downstream processing. Workflow should be refactored so webhook responds instantly while work continues asynchronously.
✅ Investigate and resolve a race condition with the database – sometimes the workflow throws unique constraint errors when multiple runs overlap.
✅ Add advanced error handling & notifications – currently, the workflow stops on any error. We need proper catch/error branches that log failures and send Slack alerts while allowing the workflow to proceed where possible.

🚀 What We Expect
- Proven experience building and maintaining complex n8n workflows in production.
- Ability to debug and optimize existing workflows quickly and reliably.
- Familiarity with OAuth2, webhooks, API integrations, and error handling best practices.
- Clean, modular solutions and clear communication.

📬 Deliverables
- Fixed and optimized workflow in our n8n instance.
- Short written summary of the changes you made.
- Suggestions (if any) for further improvements.

⚠️ Important
We are only interested in experts, as we plan to establish a long-term working relationship with the right person.
If you cannot confidently deliver on all the points above, please do not apply.

⏳ Deadline
We expect this task to be completed within 1–2 days after assignment.

How to Apply:
✅ Briefly describe your relevant experience with n8n.
✅ Mention 1–2 similar problems you’ve solved in the past.
✅ Confirm your availability to start immediately.

If you're passionate about automation and have a proven track record, we want to hear from you!

### Summary
We’re looking for a high-performing fullstack developer to join us as a technical partner in an AI-powered SaaS project with huge potential.

The product is already 95% done. We had it fully working before – it’s currently just not deployed. Your first steps will be to:

get it live again

fix potential bugs

and prepare it for launch

From there, we’ll improve it together, add new features, scale it up, and turn it into a lean, profitable machine.

This is not a vague idea – we already have strong interest from the market. The tool solves a real problem in a niche where demand is clear. As soon as it’s live again, it will start generating income – and you’ll have equity from the start, with long-term passive income potential.

Tech stack you must know well:

Python (FastAPI or similar)

Next.js / React

LLMs / OpenAI API integration

Scraping & browser automation (e.g. Playwright, Puppeteer)

Solid backend/frontend structure, APIs, proxies, queues, etc.

What you get:

Partner-level equity

Revenue share from the first launch (we already have interested users)

Option for short-term payment, if needed

Full technical ownership

Freedom to shape the product

A real chance to build something with monthly income + long-term upside

What we’re looking for:

Someone with fire in the belly

You’re not here for easy gigs – you want to build, own, and scale

You can move fast, solve problems, ship code

You take initiative, don’t wait for instructions

You value clean, efficient execution

This is a big opportunity – but only if you’re ready to commit and go all in


put the number 78 in the screening question


If this sounds like your kind of project:
→ Send a short intro
→ Show us 2–3 relevant projects or repos
→ Tell us why you’d be a great fit

Let’s relaunch and scale something big – together.

### Questions 

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

Are you open to a partnership role (equity + revenue share) with long-term upside?
How many hours per week could you realistically commit in the next 3 months?
Have you worked with OpenAI APIs or other LLMs in real projects?

## n8n | AI Agent

### Summary
I don't know if this is possible but I'm looking for someone who can take a bunch of fathom recordings and turn them into our business brain.

For context, I started doing a daily interview with my team where they ask all kinds of questions to get information out of my head.

But now I don't know what to do next.

My vision is to automatically add these recordings to a database that would then become our living knowledgebase but I'm not quite sure how to build the backend of it.

Then once we have our business brain, anyone on the team could chat with it.

Ultimately, the goal is to replace me in the day to day operations.

Can anyone help me build this?

Please have your work ready. I'd love to see an example of this in the real world.

Thank you,

Justin


P.S. we are already using n8n, digital ocean and typebot.io. So hopefully we can leverage these resources to keep building on.

Thanks

### Questions

You will be asked to answer the following questions when submitting a proposal:

## AI Prompt Refinement and Backend Integration Specialist for Financial Analysis Web Platform

### Summary
We are seeking an experienced AI prompt engineer and technical project manager to help refine a detailed meta prompt used for financial analysis and coordinate with a backend developer to build a production-ready web platform. This role is crucial for transforming our existing prompt-based analysis into a scalable, user-friendly web application that delivers structured, multi-agent investment insights.

Project Overview: Our goal is to develop a robust web platform that leverages advanced AI (such as large language models like GPT-4, Gemini 2.5 pro, etc.) to perform comprehensive financial analysis. The core of this platform relies on a sophisticated "meta prompt" that guides the AI in generating detailed, multi-faceted investment reports. We need an expert who can not only optimize this prompt for accuracy, efficiency, and future adaptability but also bridge the gap between the AI's output and a functional backend system, ensuring seamless data flow and integration with real-time financial APIs.

Scope of Work:
Prompt Refinement and Documentation:
Comprehensive Review and Improvement: Analyze the current meta prompt, which orchestrates the AI in generating structured, multi-agent investment analyses. Identify areas for improvement in clarity, conciseness, robustness, and output consistency.
Enhance Prompt Logic: Optimize the prompt's instructions to better guide the AI in handling edge cases, interpreting nuanced financial data, and producing more accurate and insightful reports.
Maintainability and Flexibility: Design the prompt with future updates and iterations in mind, ensuring it can be easily modified or expanded to accommodate new analysis parameters or data sources.
Versioning System Design: Help establish a systematic approach for managing prompt iterations, including version control, change logs, and testing protocols to ensure continuous improvement and traceability.
Detailed Documentation: Create clear, comprehensive documentation for the refined prompt, explaining its structure, parameters, expected outputs, and best practices for future use or modification.
Backend Coordination and API Integration:
Collaborative Integration Strategy: Work closely with a dedicated backend developer (who may be sourced with your assistance if needed) to seamlessly integrate the refined prompt into a scalable and efficient workflow. This will primarily involve leveraging relevant AI model APIs.
Data Flow Definition: Clearly define the structure and flow of data between the frontend (user inputs), the AI prompt, the AI model API, and the backend database. This includes designing JSON schemas or other data models for prompts, user inputs, and AI-generated outputs.
Real-time Financial Data Integration: Oversee and advise on the integration with various real-time or near-real-time financial data APIs (e.g., Polygon.io, EOD Historical Data, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, etc.). Ensure data retrieval is efficient, accurate, and robust, with consideration for API rate limits and data licensing agreements.
Workflow Automation: Help design and implement automated workflows for submitting prompts, processing AI responses, and storing analytical results in a structured format within the backend.
Website Implementation Strategy and Technical Advisory:
User Interface Scoping: Collaborate on defining the requirements for a straightforward and intuitive user interface. This will include functionalities for users to enter stock tickers, select analysis depth or parameters, and easily retrieve and view structured financial reports.
Architecture Recommendations: Propose and evaluate suitable cloud architecture recommendations for hosting and scaling the web platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud Platform, Azure). This includes considerations for serverless functions, containerization, databases, and caching strategies.
Scalability and Performance: Identify and address potential bottlenecks related to API rate limits, data processing, and user traffic, ensuring the platform can scale efficiently as user adoption grows.
Security and Data Licensing Considerations: Advise on best practices for data security, user authentication, and authorization. Provide insights into managing and complying with data licensing agreements from financial API providers.
Optional Engagements (Long-term Guidance):
Ongoing Prompt Enhancements: Provide continued guidance and expertise for future iterations and enhancements of the meta prompt, incorporating new AI capabilities or market analysis methodologies.
Platform Feature Expansion: Offer strategic input on developing new platform features, such as integrating visual charts and graphs, enabling report exports (PDF, CSV), adding watchlists, or incorporating advanced user customization options.
Deliverables:
A meticulously refined, thoroughly tested, and comprehensively documented meta prompt for AI models, optimized for financial analysis.
Detailed technical requirements and specifications for the backend integration of the AI prompt workflow, including API specifications and data models.
Successful collaboration with the backend developer to implement the prompt integration workflow, ensuring a functional and scalable system.
Comprehensive recommendations and best practices for deployment, ongoing maintenance, data sourcing strategies, API management, and security of the financial analysis platform.
Skills Required:
Exceptional AI Prompt Engineering: Proven expertise in designing, refining, and optimizing prompts for large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5 pro, or similar, with a strong understanding of their capabilities and limitations in complex analytical tasks.
Financial Data Acumen: Familiarity with financial markets, investment terminology, and a strong understanding of various financial data APIs (e.g., Polygon.io, EOD Historical Data, Finnhub, Alpha Vantage, etc.) and market data workflows. Experience working with structured and unstructured financial data is a significant plus.
Strong Technical Project Management: Demonstrated ability to manage technical projects, define clear scopes, create detailed technical specifications, and coordinate effectively with development teams (both frontend and backend).
Web Development Coordination: Experience in overseeing or coordinating frontend and backend web development teams, understanding the full software development lifecycle, and ensuring smooth integration of different components.
API Integration Experience: Practical experience with integrating third-party APIs, particularly those involving large data volumes or real-time streaming.
Problem-Solving and Analytical Skills: A keen ability to diagnose and resolve complex technical challenges, especially at the intersection of AI, data, and web development.
Budget & Timeline:
Financial Proposal: Please include your estimated hours or a fixed-price quote for the entire scope of work. We are open to discussing different engagement models based on your expertise and proposed approach.
Project Start and Duration: We are eager to commence this project within 1–2 weeks of selecting the right candidate. We anticipate the initial scope of work described above to be completed within approximately 4–6 weeks, with potential for ongoing engagement.
How to Apply:
