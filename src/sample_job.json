    "job_description": "### Summary
We run a HubSpot-focused RevOps consultancy working with B2B SaaS companies and are looking for an experienced n8n expert to help us build and maintain a growing network of AI-driven operational agents.

These agents are not basic workflows. They’re autonomous assistants powered by GPT (OpenAI or Claude), working across ClickUp, Slack, Airtable, and HubSpot with memory, conditional logic, and structured outputs.

DO NOT MESSAGE DIRECTLY. The prompts are paramount to your application being reviewed, so please fill them out if you want to be considered.

Example Agents We’ve Built (You’ll Extend/Maintain):
-Weekly Reports Agent-  Pulls ClickUp tasks, parses custom fields (QA deliverables, approval comments), syncs data into Airtable, and drafts client-ready summaries via GPT.
-Intake Bot Agent- Listens to Slack messages, parses client/project names, maps them to Airtable records using fuzzy logic, and auto-creates ClickUp tasks with fallback logic.
-Task Structuring Agent- Converts vague Slack requests into a parent task + subtasks using GPT (Claude/OpenAI), including assignee logic and task descriptions.

You’ll be expected to understand and extend this level of logic and implementation.

Tech Stack Involved:
-n8n (agent-style modular builds, execution control, error handling)
-OpenAI / Claude (prompt engineering, memory context, structured output)
-ClickUp API (task creation, field parsing, subtasks, statuses)
-Slack API (event triggers, task intake)
-Airtable (fallback memory + routing)
-HubSpot (occasionally for deal and contact enrichment)
-Webhooks & OAuth2 (for clean integration & retry logic)

Expectations:
-Strong async communication over Slack + email
-Weekly updates via short reports or Loom
-Availability to iterate on multiple agents over time
-Clear, maintainable flows with smart error handling

Requirements:
-2+ years building advanced n8n workflows
-Hands-on experience with OpenAI, Claude, or similar LLMs inside automation
-Familiarity with ClickUp, Airtable, and Slack APIs
-Can implement memory, fallback logic, and dynamic prompt routing
-Writes clean, modular nodes with documentation",

"applicant_questions": [
     "Describe how you would structure an n8n agent that monitors Slack messages for task intake, identifies the client/project from an Airtable list, and creates a ClickUp task. What nodes would you use, and how would you handle ambiguous or unknown clients?",
     "We want to build agents that can retain recent task context across multiple executions (e.g., remembering a client’s last Slack thread or previous report contents). What’s your approach to implementing short-term memory in n8n?",
     "Which of the following APIs have you worked with directly inside n8n? (Mark all that apply) ClickUp Airtable HubSpot Slack OpenAI Claude (Anthropic) For any checked, share an example of a real flow you built with it.",
     "How do you design your n8n flows to be fault-tolerant? Describe how you’d handle timeouts, missing data, or failed API calls across a multi-step agent (e.g., pulling from ClickUp, writing to Airtable, then triggering GPT)."
