Based on the analysis of the PRD and current codebase in src/rag_worker/, this plan addresses both MVP completion and future enhancements. The core RAG functionality is     
   already implemented - focus is now on deployment, testing, and scaling.

  Current State Assessment

  ‚úÖ Completed: Core RAG pipeline, FastAPI inference server, data models, prompts, vector retrieval
  üîÑ In Progress: Performance monitoring (timing decorators added)
  ‚ùå Missing: Infrastructure deployment, comprehensive testing, production secrets management

  Implementation Notes for Task-Master-AI

  Priority Order

  1. MVP Milestones 1-3 are critical path for production deployment
  2. Future Enhancement Milestone 1 should be planned concurrently with MVP completion
  3. Future Enhancement Milestones 2-5 can be prioritized based on user feedback and business requirements

  Dependencies

  - MVP Milestone 2 depends on completion of Milestone 1
  - MVP Milestone 3 depends on completion of Milestone 2
  - Future enhancements can be developed in parallel streams after MVP completion

  Resource Allocation

  - Estimate 2-3 weeks for MVP completion with current codebase
  - Future enhancements represent 6-12 months of additional development
  - Consider dedicated DevOps resources for infrastructure milestones

  Risk Mitigation

  - Implement comprehensive testing before production deployment
  - Use blue-green deployment strategies for zero-downtime updates
  - Maintain rollback capabilities at each deployment stage
  - Monitor costs carefully during scaling implementations
